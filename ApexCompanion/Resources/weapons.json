It is useful when contesting sniper rifles due to it's higher rate of firing speed. The G7 also boasts a 1.75Ã— headshot multiplier. Glowing iron-sight may obscure vision for some players. Can easily be threatened by SMGs and shotguns at shorter distances. Has a slow bullet travel speed which maskes it more difficult to hit enemies at longer distances."
