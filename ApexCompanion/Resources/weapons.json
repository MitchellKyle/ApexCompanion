Good in medium to long range fights. It has poor base ammo capacity. Can perform decently at close range when firing from the hip while in burst fire mode. Otherwise poor close-range performance while in single fire mode. At close distances, is threatened by SMGs and Shotguns."

It performs well at close to medium range and for an assault rifle, also at long range. Great ironsights, and above average hipfire performance.

The projectiles fired from the gun are large (but slow) and are barely affected by gravity. But the large projectiles also negatively affect vision while firing. Recoil is easily controlled when firing in short bursts. A unique feature of the L-Star is it can open doors by shooting the handle. When continuously holding the trigger, recoil is much greater and the L-Star will overheat after 3 seconds (causing reload animation). ADS speed is very slow (-60%)."

The Sentinel has high damage per shot and bullets penetrate enemies, allowing you to hit multiple targets with one shot. Bullets will shred any shield health instantly and has 0% leg damage reduction when charged. Can open doors by shooting the handle. It is bolt-action which punishes you more severely for missing shots compared to other snipers. Terrible hip-fire accuracy. Charged shots (using sheild cells) essentially discard headshots: Hitting a charged headshot on a standard legend without a helmet will still deal 140 damage. Switching weapons takes a long time without a sniper stock."
