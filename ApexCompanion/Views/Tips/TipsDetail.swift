A player can collect crafting materials that allows them to craft gear, weapons, weapon attachments, ammo, or level up an evo shield. A player can get crafting materials by opening any bin (5 per bin) or by accessing a replicator canister. Replicators have been added in certain areas across each map. More replicators also drop throughout the match in random places much like neutral care packages. Each replicator position has four interactable terminals. Three of the terminals give you crafting materials (25 per terminal) and one main terminal that allows you to craft. The main terminal has three interactable screens, meaning up to three items can be crafted at once. The main terminal can be used by all three player at once, or one player can use the terminal to craft multiple items at once.")

When crafting ammo, it will produce one box of each type of ammo needed for you guns. In other words if you have a gun using shotgun ammo and another using heavy ammo, it will give you a box of each. Evo shields can also be upgraded at the main terminals. Spending 45 crafting materials will subtract 100 damage needed to obtain the next color level. Note that when upgrading Evo shields, your armor is removed and deposited into the machine. This leaves you vulnerable for the duration of the crafting process.")
